    <h3>What is Doekoe(sh)?</h3>
    <p>
      Doekoe(sh) was created for myself because I was done with keeping track of my
      expenses and incomes in a spreadsheet. Because I own my own business
      I need to keep track of everything for tax purposes.
      The tool makes it simpler to see when and how many money has come in every quarter.
      You could eventually use this to file your tax returns.
      Or just for fun to see how your business is doing!

    <h3>How does Doekoe(sh) work?</h3>
    <p>
      Simple! Just follow the steps to add a new income or expense.

    <h3>Who created Doekoe(sh)?</h3>
    <p>
      Doekoe(sh) was created as a fun side project by Jens de Rond.
      Jens is currently a student at Avans University studying Computer Science.
